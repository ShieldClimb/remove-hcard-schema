Boost WordPress SEO by removing outdated hCard microformat and optimizing schema, fixing conflicts for better search rankings and performance.

== Description ==

Outdated schema can significantly impact your WordPress site's SEO performance. 

One such outdated format is the hCard microformat, which was once used for displaying contact information but has since been replaced by more efficient schema types like Person and Organization. 

Retaining old and redundant schema such as hCard can create conflicts with modern formats, leading to errors and inefficiencies in your structured data.

Our Remove hCard Schema in WordPress plugin simplifies the process of removing outdated hCard microformat from your website, ensuring your structured data is clean, up-to-date, and fully optimized for search engines. 

By eliminating conflicts caused by old schema types, you allow search engines to better understand your content and improve your site's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs).
